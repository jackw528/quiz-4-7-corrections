# Quizzes 4-7 Corrections

## Quiz 4

### Question 2

The correct answer was " let hours = prompt("Enter the number of hours worked this week.", 40); " This is the correct answer because default values can be included in prompt statements. This is done by adding a comma after the prompt and then adding the default value inside of the paranthesis.

### Question 7

The correct answers outside of what I chose were " "", false, and undefined ". These all are considered falsey by JavaScript.

### Question 8

The correct answer was " const PI = 3.14; " This is because the capilatized PI stands out more in the lines of code.

### Question 10

I missed the answers undefined, null, object, and symbol. I also incorrectly answered integer. Integer is incorrect because an integer is a type of number, not an individual data type.

## Quiz 5

### Question 1

The correct answer was " a < b && a < c   c > a || c > b " because the logical OR statement completes the bottom IF statement. This is because both conditions have to be true to make the statement output true. If one or neither is false, it outputs false.

### Question 2

The correct answer " false   true " is correct because the operator " !! " is NOT NOT or the " ! " operator twice. When the NOT operation is applied to the varible, the console logs false and the NOT NOT, which is rhe opposite, is true.

### Question 3

I answered incorrectly " =, >, ===, ==, <, >= " and did not answer " ! ". The question asks for all the logical operators , which are " &&, ||, and ! ". The other answers are operators, but not logical operators.

### Question 4

The correct answer was " x === y  x !== y " because " === " checks for value and data type. " == ", however, does not.

### Question 5

I incorrectly answered " = " and all the other answers I chose were correct. " = " on its own is not a valid relational operator, it is an assignment operator.

### Question 10

The answer to question 10 was " switch (dayCode)  case 0: day = "Monday"; break;  case 1: day = "Tuesday"; break;   case 2: day = "Wednesday"; break;   case 3: day = "Thursday"; break;  case 4: day = "Friday"; break;   case 5: day = "Saturday"; break;  case 6: day = "Sunday"; break;   default: day = "an unknown day"; break;} ". This is because cases do not use quotations to show the case number.

### Question 11

The correct answer was " 1. Setup   2. Expression   3. Loop Body  4. Update  5. Return to Step 2. ". Loop body is before update because if the loop were to update after it looped, there would be no update.
